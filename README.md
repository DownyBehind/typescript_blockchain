Learning Typescript by making a Blockchain with it

### why we should add tsconfig.json

because node.js doesn't understand typescript, so we should transfer typescript code to common js.

in tsconfig.json you can see some option for compile.

"module" is what kind of js variant do you want to comile ts
"target" is version of js

basically i like to exclude node module for compile.
